FIRST Robotics Competition Team Website
=======================================

I created this website for my robotics team's 2011 competition season. This website won the Best Website Award at the Michigan State Championship.

One of the goals in making this website was to generate interest in the community and to promote STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). A medieval theme was chosen for this website since it is the home of the barons, our team's mascot. Graphics and animations are used throughout this website to make it appealing to younger kids. Malathar’s dragons were animated using Photoshop, and a customized Google map is also displayed on the website. The banners on the side feature quick links to the US FIRST robotics website, the FIRST robotics in Michigan website, and the websites of the team’s major sponsors.
